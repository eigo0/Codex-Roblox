Downloads
Download official builds and source packages from the Releases page:
https://github.com/eigo0/Codex-Roblox/releases

Visit the Releases page to download the release artifacts. The releases contain platform-specific packages. Choose the package that matches your platform and workflow, such as:
- Codex-Roblox-Profiler-v1.2.0-win.zip
- Codex-Roblox-CLI-v1.2.0-linux.tar.gz
- Codex-Roblox-StudioPlugin-v1.2.0.rbxm

If you download an executable or packaged artifact, run it in an isolated environment for testing before using it in production workflows. Use official releases from the Releases page for reproducible results.

Installation
The project provides two main forms of delivery: prebuilt artifacts and source. Choose the one that fits your workflow.

Option A â€” Prebuilt packages (recommended for QA)
1. Go to the Releases page: https://github.com/eigo0/Codex-Roblox/releases
2. Download the package for your OS. Example: Codex-Roblox-Profiler-v1.2.0-win.zip
3. Extract the package to a working directory.
4. Run the CLI or Studio plugin per the included README in the release.

Option B â€” Build from source
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install build dependencies (see BUILD.md in the repo).
3. Run the build script:
   - Windows: build\build.ps1
   - Linux: ./build.sh
4. Use the produced artifacts like the prebuilt packages above.

Quick start
Start a simple profiling run with the CLI on Windows:
1. Extract the release package.
2. Open a command prompt in the extracted folder.
3. Run:
   Codex-Roblox-CLI.exe --attach --target "RobloxPlayer" --out session-001.json --duration 120 --sample-interval 200

This command attaches the profiler to the Roblox process named RobloxPlayer. It records for 120 seconds with a 200 ms sampling interval and writes results to session-001.json.

Core concepts
- Sampling vs. tracing: Sampling records periodic metrics (FPS, memory). Tracing records function-level events. Sampling has lower overhead.
- Overhead: Keep sampling intervals larger on low-end PCs. Use tracing sparingly.
- Safe hooks: Codex-Roblox exposes safe, opt-in hooks for instrumentation. Do not enable hooks in production.
- Export formats: JSON for automated parsing. CSV for spreadsheet analysis. Both formats include timestamps and metric labels.

Profiles and metrics
Codex collects a core set of metrics every tick:
- Timestamp (ms)
- Frame time (ms)
- Frames per second (FPS)
- Lua memory (KB)
- Total memory (KB)
- CPU usage percent (process)
- Active scripts count

The profiler can also record:
- GC events and GC time
- Top Lua functions by time
- Resource load durations (assets)

Memory snapshot format
Memory snapshots include:
- Total Lua heap size.
- Per-module allocations (if symbols available).
- Table and string count estimates.
- GC phase durations.

Use the CLI to convert snapshots to CSV and plot charts with your favorite tooling.

Sample data schema (JSON)
{
  "sessionId": "session-001",
  "startTime": "2025-08-01T12:00:00Z",
  "samples": [
    {
      "t": 0,
      "fps": 30,
      "frametime_ms": 33.3,
      "lua_memory_kb": 51200,
      "total_memory_kb": 102400,
      "cpu_percent": 40.2
    }
  ]
}

Sample scripts
Below are safe, sample Lua snippets for in-game instrumentation. These examples show how to log simple frame-time measures and send them to a local collector for analysis. Use such code only in testing sessions.

1) Simple frame timer
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
local stats = {}

local last = tick()
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(delta)
  local t = tick()
  local frametime = delta * 1000
  table.insert(stats, {time = t, frametime_ms = frametime})
  if #stats >= 1000 then
    -- send stats to client-side logger or file sink
    -- Replace sendToCollector with your transport
    sendToCollector(stats)
    stats = {}
  end
end)

2) Memory checkpoint
local function snapshotMemory()
  local mem = collectgarbage("count") -- KB
  return {time = os.time(), lua_kb = mem}
end

3) Tagging long-running functions
local function timedRun(fn, label)
  local start = tick()
  local ok, res = pcall(fn)
  local dur = (tick() - start) * 1000
  if dur > 20 then
    log("hotpath", {label = label, duration_ms = dur})
  end
  return ok, res
end

Integration with Roblox Studio
Codex-Roblox offers a Studio plugin that helps developers run controlled performance tests while developing. The plugin can:
- Run client-side test scenarios from the Editor.
- Capture frames and memory across simulated device profiles.
- Export results to local files or a CI server.

Install the plugin from the Releases page. The plugin ships as an .rbxm file. Drop it into Studio and enable it in Plugins -> Manage Plugins.

Plugin workflow
1. Open Roblox Studio.
2. Load the Codex plugin.
3. Choose device profile (e.g., low-end, mid-range).
4. Start a run. The plugin will capture the metrics and show a live chart.
5. Export the data to JSON for offline analysis.

Security and safe testing
Use Codex-Roblox for development and testing only. Do not use tools that modify client behavior in live games without proper consent. Always follow Roblox Terms of Service and community guidelines. Test in isolated environments for reproducible results.

Follow these safety practices:
- Run tests on non-production accounts.
- Use test servers and test places.
- Keep instrumentation disabled in public builds.
- Analyze artifacts in a secure environment.

Low-end PC optimization guide
This section lists concrete steps to improve performance on low-end hardware.

1) Reduce draw calls
- Batch parts and use MeshParts where possible.
- Avoid excessive Part count. Use instancing.
- Simplify materials and reduce texture sizes.

2) Control physics
- Turn off unnecessary collisions for decorative objects.
- Use Anchored where possible.
- Lower SimulationRadius or use server-side constraints to reduce client physics.

3) Minimize Lua work on heartbeat
- Do not run expensive loops on Heartbeat.
- Use debounce and event-driven patterns.
- Cache references to services and instances.

4) Use streaming and LOD
- Load high-detail assets only when near the player.
- Use Level of Detail (LOD) meshes and texture swapping.

5) Optimize asset sizes
- Compress textures.
- Reuse models and assets.

6) Reduce memory churn
- Avoid creating many short-lived tables.
- Reuse tables with table.clear or custom pooling.
- Avoid heavy string concatenation in tight loops.

7) Profile frequently
- Run short profiling sessions after each major change.
- Keep sample intervals larger if you test on low-end hardware.

Advanced topics
- Script sampling strategies: choose sample intervals that match your workload. Use 100-500 ms on low-end hardware.
- Symbol mapping: map obfuscated or minified module names to source names for better stack traces.
- CI integration: use headless clients to run automated performance checks. Fail builds when FPS drops under a threshold.
- Remote tracing: collect server-side and client-side traces and merge them for end-to-end analysis.
- Time-series databases: send metrics to InfluxDB or Prometheus for long-term trend analysis.

Troubleshooting
- The profiler reports no data:
  - Verify the target process name.
  - Ensure you run with proper permissions.
  - Confirm the plugin or CLI has access to the target.
- High overhead during tracing:
  - Switch to sampling mode.
  - Increase sample interval.
  - Limit tracing to selected modules.
- Memory snapshots large:
  - Use filters for modules.
  - Take snapshots at strategic points, not every minute.
